## Brief description
This project is being developed as part of the NASA International Space Apps Challenge 2020 in the category "Automated detection of Hazards". We aim to design an app capable of identifying fires using ML algorithms and performing an assessment of the potential impact produced by these hazards.

## This repository
In this repository you will find our codes, information about the datasets used to train the models together with the documentation used as reference. In addition to it, we provide a sketch of the UI of the app.
 
## Contact info
We are a group of four physicists, an industrial engineer and a software developer from Colombia.
